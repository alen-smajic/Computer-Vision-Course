**Course Description:** How can we enable machines to obtain semantic information from image data? How can computers gain a high-level understanding of visual input, which in turn is necessary to solve many elaborate tasks previously reserved for humans?—The objective of this course is to present a modern, data-driven approach to solve these problems.

We will introduce several computer vision problems, ranging from object classification and localization to semantic segmentation and video analysis. The fundamentals of the classical approaches to these problems will be covered, but the main focus will be on deep learning algorithms—especially convolutional neural networks—that are used to hierarchically extract increasingly more abstract features from images, analogous to processes performed by the human visual system.

Besides the theoretical understanding of these algorithms, emphasis is placed on gaining practical experience: There will be weekly exercises accompagnying the lecture in the first half of the semester and a group project spanning the second half, with the final presentation of the group project contributing 30 percent to the course grade.

The assignments are based on the [Stanford CS231n course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).
